# Bophades Coding Standard

The following establishes a coding standard for the Olympus v3/Bophades repo.

-   External/public functions and variables are `lowerCamelCase`
    -   ex. function `deposit()`
    -   ex. variable `totalDebt`
-   Internal/private functions and variables are `_prefixed` and `lowerCamelCase`
    -   ex. `_checkApproval()`
-   Contract names are `UpperCamelCase`
    -   ex. `OlympusTreasury`
-   Function arguments are `suffixed_`
    -   `_issueReward(address to_)`
-   Module-specific functions are always `UPPERCASE`
    -   ex. `KEYCODE()`
-   Errors defined in modules must be suffixed by module's respective keycode
    -   ex. `TRSRY_NotApproved(...)`
    -   Policies have no such restriction
-   Regular Comments use `//`
    -   `// Regular comment hurr durr`
-   NatSpec comments use `///`
    -   `/// @notice Natspec comment`
-   Contract and function groups or other major sections in SOURCE files should be denoted with

```
    //============================================================================================//
    //                                           HEADER                                           //
    //============================================================================================//
```

    - This is to denote sections when scrolling through large files

-   All other sections should be denoted with single line header:
    `// ========= HEADER ========= // `

## Principles (NOT HARD RULES)

-   Aim for clear and succinct code
-   Explicit over implicit
-   Write code PRIMARILY for humans, not machines
-   Comment on WHY, not WHAT. Code should be able to explain "what".
-   Aim to write code that is self-documenting
-   Meaning clear function names and variables
-   Aim for gas-efficiency with above constraints
