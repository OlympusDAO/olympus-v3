     * @dev Ensure we are not in a Vault context when this function is called, by attempting a no-op internal
     * balance operation. If we are already in a Vault transaction (e.g., a swap, join, or exit), the Vault's
     * reentrancy protection will cause this function to revert.
     *
     * The exact function call doesn't really matter: we're just trying to trigger the Vault reentrancy check
     * (and not hurt anything in case it works). An empty operation array with no specific operation at all works
     * for that purpose, and is also the least expensive in terms of gas and bytecode size.
     *
     * Call this at the top of any function that can cause a state change in a pool and is either public itself,
     * or called by a public function *outside* a Vault operation (e.g., join, exit, or swap).
     *
     * If this is *not* called in functions that are vulnerable to the read-only reentrancy issue described
     * here (https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345), those functions are unsafe,
     * and subject to manipulation that may result in loss of funds.
