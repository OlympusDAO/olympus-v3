# Batch Scripts

This directory contains batch scripts for the Olympus DAO multisig.

## Fork Testing

There is no way to directly run the scripts (in their current state) on a forked chain.

If you are using Tenderly, you can run each step of the script manually through the "Send Transaction" feature on the dashboard.
